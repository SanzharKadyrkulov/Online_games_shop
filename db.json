      "describtion": "South of the Moniyan Empire lies a bottomless abyss, engraved into this barren landscape as if an ancient demon used the sharpest of blades to carve a disfiguring scar into the Land of Dawn. People call this the Shadow Abyss.  Sealed away at the bottom of this legendary abyss, lies the most terrible demon in the Land of Dawn - the Abyss Dominator. But as the seal slowly fades, the will of the abyss gradually grows stronger.",
